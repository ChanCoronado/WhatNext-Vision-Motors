WhatNext Vision Motors: Shaping The Future Of Mobility With Innovation And Excellence

🚀 Project Overview

This Capstone Project involves the development of a tailored Salesforce Customer Relationship Management (CRM) solution for the automotive company, WhatNext Vision Motors. The system transforms manual order processing into seamless, automated workflows, ensuring real-time inventory accuracy and enhancing customer engagement.

The solution leverages a powerful combination of Salesforce Flow (for declarative automation) and Apex (for complex transactional integrity).

✨ Key Automation Goals

The implementation was centered around achieving three core, verifiable automation objectives:

Intelligent Dealer Assignment:

Function: Automatically assigns pending vehicle orders to the nearest available dealer based on the customer's location address.

Technology: Record-Triggered Flow.

Real-Time Inventory Integrity:

Function: Enforces transactional validation to prevent the creation of orders for vehicles with zero (0) stock quantity.

Technology: Apex Trigger (Before Insert/Update Logic).

Scheduled Customer Engagement:

Function: Configures a scheduled process to send automated email reminders one day before the customer's scheduled test drive appointment.

Technology: Record-Triggered Flow with Scheduled Path.

🛠️ Technology Stack (Summary)

Platform: Salesforce Customer 360 Platform, Custom Lightning App ("WhatNext Vision Motors").

Data Model: Six (6) Custom Objects (Vehicle, Vehicle Order, Vehicle Customer, etc.).

Pro-Code: Apex for Validation (VehicleOrderTriggerHandler) and Stock Deduction.
